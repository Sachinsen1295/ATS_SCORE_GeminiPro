      "memory. We showed that our RAG models obtain state of the art results on open-domain QA. We\n",
      "found that people prefer RAG’s generation over purely parametric BART, ﬁnding RAG more factual\n",
      "and speciﬁc. We conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating\n",
      "its effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hot-swapped to update the model\n",
      "without requiring any retraining. In future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components\n",
      "can be jointly pre-trained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to BART or some\n",
      "another objective. Our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and non-parametric\n",
      "memories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a\n",
      "wide variety of NLP tasks.\n",
      "9Broader Impact\n",
      "This work offers several positive societal beneﬁts over previous work: the fact that it is more\n",
      "strongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less\n",
      "with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be\n",
      "employed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct beneﬁt to society, for example by endowing it\n",
      "with a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\n",
      "effective at their jobs.\n",
      "With these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge\n",
      "source, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. Since RAG can be\n",
      "employed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [ 50] are valid here, although arguably\n",
      "to a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in\n",
      "the news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of spam/phishing\n",
      "content [ 54]. Advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the\n",

      "9Broader Impact\n",
      "This work offers several positive societal beneﬁts over previous work: the fact that it is more\n",

      "With these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge\n",

      "achieve strong performance on a single task, while we show that a single retrieval-based architecture\n",
      "can be ﬁne-tuned for strong performance on a variety of tasks.\n",
      "Memory-based Architectures Our document index can be seen as a large external memory for\n",
      "neural networks to attend to, analogous to memory networks [ 64,55]. Concurrent work [ 14] learns\n",
      "to retrieve a trained embedding for each entity in the input, rather than to retrieve raw text as in our\n",
      "work. Other work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over\n",
      "fact embeddings [ 15,13]. A key feature of our memory is that it is comprised of raw text rather\n",
      "distributed representations, which makes the memory both (i) human-readable, lending a form of\n",
      "interpretability to our model, and (ii) human-writable, enabling us to dynamically update the model’s\n",
      "memory by editing the document index. This approach has also been used in knowledge-intensive\n",
      "dialog, where generators have been conditioned on retrieved text directly, albeit obtained via TF-IDF\n",
      "rather than end-to-end learnt retrieval [9].\n",
      "Retrieve-and-Edit approaches Our method shares some similarities with retrieve-and-edit style\n",
      "approaches, where a similar training input-output pair is retrieved for a given input, and then edited\n",
      "to provide a ﬁnal output. These approaches have proved successful in a number of domains including\n",
      "Machine Translation [ 18,22] and Semantic Parsing [ 21]. Our approach does have several differences,\n",
      "including less of emphasis on lightly editing a retrieved item, but on aggregating content from several\n",
      "pieces of retrieved content, as well as learning latent retrieval, and retrieving evidence documents\n",
      "rather than related training pairs. This said, RAG techniques may work well in these settings, and\n",
      "could represent promising future work.\n",
      "6 Discussion\n",
      "In this work, we presented hybrid generation models with access to parametric and non-parametric\n",
      "memory. We showed that our RAG models obtain state of the art results on open-domain QA. We\n",
      "found that people prefer RAG’s generation over purely parametric BART, ﬁnding RAG more factual\n",
      "and speciﬁc. We conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating\n",
      "its effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hot-swapped to update the model\n",
      "without requiring any retraining. In future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components\n",
      "can be jointly pre-trained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to BART or some\n",
      "another objective. Our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and non-parametric\n",
      "memories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a\n",
      "wide variety of NLP tasks.\n",
      "9Broader Impact\n",
      "This work offers several positive societal beneﬁts over previous work: the fact that it is more\n",
      "strongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less\n",
      "with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be\n",
      "employed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct beneﬁt to society, for example by endowing it\n",
      "with a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\n",
      "effective at their jobs.\n",
      "With these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge\n",
      "source, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. Since RAG can be\n",
      "employed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [ 50] are valid here, although arguably\n",
      "to a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in\n",
      "the news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of spam/phishing\n",
      "content [ 54]. Advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the\n",
      "coming decades [ 16]. In order to mitigate these risks, AI systems could be employed to ﬁght against\n",
      "misleading content and automated spam/phishing.\n",

      "9Broader Impact\n",
      "This work offers several positive societal beneﬁts over previous work: the fact that it is more\n",

      "with a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\n",
      "effective at their jobs.\n",
      "With these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge\n",

      "6 Discussion\n",

      "memory. We showed that our RAG models obtain state of the art results on open-domain QA. We\n",
      "found that people prefer RAG’s generation over purely parametric BART, ﬁnding RAG more factual\n",
      "and speciﬁc. We conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating\n",
      "its effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hot-swapped to update the model\n",
      "without requiring any retraining. In future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components\n",
      "can be jointly pre-trained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to BART or some\n",
      "another objective. Our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and non-parametric\n",
      "memories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a\n",
      "wide variety of NLP tasks.\n",
      "9Broader Impact\n",
      "This work offers several positive societal beneﬁts over previous work: the fact that it is more\n",
      "strongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less\n",
      "with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be\n",
      "employed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct beneﬁt to society, for example by endowing it\n",
      "with a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\n",
      "effective at their jobs.\n",
      "With these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge\n",
      "source, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. Since RAG can be\n",
      "employed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [ 50] are valid here, although arguably\n",
      "to a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in\n",
      "the news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of spam/phishing\n",

      "found that people prefer RAG’s generation over purely parametric BART, ﬁnding RAG more factual\n",

      "9Broader Impact\n",
      "This work offers several positive societal beneﬁts over previous work: the fact that it is more\n",

      "with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be\n",

      "with a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\n",
      "effective at their jobs.\n",
      "With these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge\n",

      "employed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [ 50] are valid here, although arguably\n",

      "9Broader Impact\n",
      "This work offers several positive societal beneﬁts over previous work: the fact that it is more\n",

      "with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be\n",

      "with a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\n",
      "effective at their jobs.\n",
      "With these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge\n",

      "memory by editing the document index. This approach has also been used in knowledge-intensive\n",

      "Retrieve-and-Edit approaches Our method shares some similarities with retrieve-and-edit style\n",
      "approaches, where a similar training input-output pair is retrieved for a given input, and then edited\n",
      "to provide a ﬁnal output. These approaches have proved successful in a number of domains including\n",
      "Machine Translation [ 18,22] and Semantic Parsing [ 21]. Our approach does have several differences,\n",

      "6 Discussion\n",
      "In this work, we presented hybrid generation models with access to parametric and non-parametric\n",
      "memory. We showed that our RAG models obtain state of the art results on open-domain QA. We\n",
      "found that people prefer RAG’s generation over purely parametric BART, ﬁnding RAG more factual\n",
      "and speciﬁc. We conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating\n",
      "its effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hot-swapped to update the model\n",
      "without requiring any retraining. In future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components\n",
      "can be jointly pre-trained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to BART or some\n",
      "another objective. Our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and non-parametric\n",
      "memories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a\n",
      "wide variety of NLP tasks.\n",
      "9Broader Impact\n",
      "This work offers several positive societal beneﬁts over previous work: the fact that it is more\n",
      "strongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less\n",
      "with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be\n",
      "employed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct beneﬁt to society, for example by endowing it\n",
      "with a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\n",
      "effective at their jobs.\n",
      "With these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge\n",
      "source, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. Since RAG can be\n",
      "employed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [ 50] are valid here, although arguably\n",
      "to a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in\n",
      "the news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of spam/phishing\n",
      "content [ 54]. Advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the\n",
      "coming decades [ 16]. In order to mitigate these risks, AI systems could be employed to ﬁght against\n",
      "misleading content and automated spam/phishing.\n",

      "6 Discussion\n",
      "In this work, we presented hybrid generation models with access to parametric and non-parametric\n",
      "memory. We showed that our RAG models obtain state of the art results on open-domain QA. We\n",
      "found that people prefer RAG’s generation over purely parametric BART, ﬁnding RAG more factual\n",
      "and speciﬁc. We conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating\n",
      "its effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hot-swapped to update the model\n",
      "without requiring any retraining. In future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components\n",
      "can be jointly pre-trained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to BART or some\n",
      "another objective. Our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and non-parametric\n",
      "memories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a\n",
      "wide variety of NLP tasks.\n",
      "9Broader Impact\n",
      "This work offers several positive societal beneﬁts over previous work: the fact that it is more\n",
      "strongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less\n",
      "with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be\n",
      "employed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct beneﬁt to society, for example by endowing it\n",
      "with a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\n",
      "effective at their jobs.\n",
      "With these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge\n",
      "source, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. Since RAG can be\n",
      "employed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [ 50] are valid here, although arguably\n",
      "to a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in\n",
      "the news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of spam/phishing\n",
      "content [ 54]. Advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the\n",

Follow along to\\nstay up to date!\\nOpen AI U pdates\\nOpenAI had their big developer day this week, and I wanted to call out two key announcements\\n(and trends): increasing context windows and decreasing costs.\\nWhen I think about the monetization of AI (and which “layers” monetize \\x00rst) I’ve always\\nthought it would follow the below order, with each layer lagging the one that comes before it.\\n1. Raw silicon (chips like Nvidia bought in large quantities to build out infra to service\\nupcoming demand).\\n2. Model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc as companies start building out AI).\\n35\\nType your email...

Hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, GC P as companies look for cloud GPUs who aren’t building out\\ntheir own data centers)\\n4. Infra (Data layer, orchestration, monitoring, ops, etc)\\n5. Durable Applications\\nWe’ve clearly well underway of the \\x00rst 3 layers monetizing. Just starting the fourth layer, with\\nthe \\x00\\x00h layer showing up in some pockets, but not really widespread monetization (and I should\\nclarify - scalable monetization). The caveat is important - I’ve heard of a well known company\\nthat had an o\\x00shore team handling lots of manual customer work (ie responses). And this\\n“product” had a ~50% g ross margin. When they started using large language models from\\nOpenAI, the gross margin on the same product went to -100%! (y es, that’s negative 100%) . While\\nthe product was “monetizing” I wouldn’t count it as scalable monetization.\\nWe haven’t quite yet cracked AI used in production in widespread fashion. There are many\\nlimiters here - data security and compliance are big ones. But even more important right now is\\ncost. At the end of the day, these large language models are quite expensive! And as a vendor\\nusing them, you can either pass through the costs to your end customer (to maintain your gross\\nmargins), or eat the costs and lower your gross margins (because the customer isn’t willing to pay\\nthe incremental cost for incremental functionality brought about by AI), and hope the model\\nproviders lower their costs in the future. It seems like every company has been experimenting.\\nSaying things like “just build out all the AI functionality now and then we’ll evaluate if\\ncustomers will pay for it.” Now that we’re getting through this initial wave of experimentation\\nand AI buildout, there’s quite a bit of sticker shock when the OpenAI bills come due! People are\\nlooking to build in model portability to enable them to switch to lower cost models (or open\\nsource).11/14/23, 8:35 PM Clouded Judgement 11.10.23 - by Jamin Ball\\nhttps://cloudedjudgement.substack.com/p/clouded-judgement-111023 3/21This brings me back to the initial point - the two announcements from OpenAI I want to\\nhighlight here.\\n1. Context length: Context window of GPT 4 Turbo went from 8k tokens to 128k  tokens (think\\nof this as ~300 p ages of text worth of input). This means what you can put into a prompt just\\nwent up dramatically\\n2. Costs decreasing: GP T 4 Turbo is 3x cheaper for input tokens (think of this as roughly the\\nlength of the prompt) and 2x cheaper for output tokens. This equates to $0.01 p er 1k input\\ntokens, and $0.03 p er 1k output tokens. On a blended basis, GP T 4 Turbo is roughly 2.5-3x\\ncheaper than GPT 4.\\nThe cost decrease is very meaningful - it’s lowers the barrier to experiment with AI, and also\\nlowers the barrier for these AI functionalities to be pushed into production (because vendors\\ndon’t have to increase price nearly as much). Also - As Moin pointed out on Twitter / X, as\\ncontext windows increase the need for task / domain-speci\\x00c models (or \\x00ne-tuned models)\\ndecreases. The counter argument to this is will we be able to \\x00nd enough high quality long\\ncontext training data. Either way - it’s clear these models are becoming cheaper and more\\ne\\x00ective, which is an exciting future for AI! I think we’re about to see an explosion of good\\nbusiness model AI applications in the near future. 2024 w ill be the year of AI applications!\\nDatadog G ives So\\x00w are t he A ll C lear?\\nThis week so\\x00ware stocks shot up on Tuesday, largely a result of Datadog’s quarterly earnings.\\nDatadog in particular was up ~30%. S o what happened? They made a number of comments about\\noptimizations easing up, and the worst being behind us. Here are some quotes:11/14/23, 8:35 PM Clouded Judgement 11.10.23 - by Jamin Ball\\nhttps://cloudedjudgement.substack.com/p/clouded-judgement-111023 4/21“It looks like we\\'ve hit an in\\x00ection point. It looks like there\\'s a lot less overhang now in\\nterms of what needs to be optimized or could be optimized by customers. It looks like\\nalso optimization is less intense and less widespread across the customer base.”\\n“We had a very healthy start to Q4 in October...the trends we see in early Q4 are stronger\\nthan they\\'ve been for the past year.”\\n“As we look at our overall customer activity, we continue to see customers optimizing\\nbut with less impact than we experienced in Q2, contributing to our usage growth with\\nexisting customers improving in Q3 relative to Q2.”\\n“As a reminder, last quarter, we discussed a cohort of customers who began optimizing\\nabout a year ago and we said that they appear to stabilize their users growth at the end of\\nQ2. That trend has held for the past several months with that cohorts usage remaining\\nstable throughout Q3.”\\nDatadog was one of the \\x00rst companies to really highlight an improving macro environment.\\nAnd even more important, they called out a great month of October (\\x00rst month of Q4 for them).\\nSo how do we contrast their positive commentary, with largely neutral commentary from the rest\\nof the so\\x00ware universe? Most likely Datadog is seeing trends more unique to their own\\nbusiness. As the market puts a greater emphasis on bundled platforms today vs point solutions,\\nthey appear to be an incremental winner of market share. Best of breed platforms (with more of a\\nusage based model) will recover \\x00rst (in terms of revenue growth recovery). Datadog appears to\\nbe in that bucket and recovering \\x00rst. This doesn’t mean the rest of the so\\x00ware universe will\\nfollow suite. There will be many “pretenders” who never recover and \\x00nd themselves bundled\\ninto oblivion.
